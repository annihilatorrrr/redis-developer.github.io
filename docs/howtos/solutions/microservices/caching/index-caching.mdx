## What is query caching?

Have you ever been in a situation where your database queries are slowing down?
Query caching is the technique you need to speed database queries by using different caching methods while keeping costs down! Imagine that you built an e-commerce application. It started small but is growing fast. By now, you have an extensive product catalog and millions of customers.

That's good for business, but a hardship for technology. Your queries to primary database (MongoDB/ Postgressql) are beginning to slow down, even though you already attempted to optimize them. Even though you can squeak out a little extra performance, it isn't enough to satisfy your customers.

## Why you should use Redis for query caching

Redis is an in-memory datastore, best known for caching. Redis allows you to reduce the load on a primary database while speeding up database reads.

With any e-commerce application, there is one specific type of query that is most often requested. If you guessed that it’s the product search query, you’re correct!

To improve product search in an e-commerce application, you can implement one of following caching patterns:

- **Cache prefetching**: An entire product catalog can be pre-cached in Redis, and the application can perform any product query on Redis similar to the primary database.
- **Cache-aside** pattern: Redis is filled on demand, based on whatever search parameters are requested by the frontend.

If you use **Redis Cloud**, cache aside is easier due to its support for JSON and search. You also get additional features such as real-time performance, High scalability, resiliency, and fault tolerance. You can also call upon high-availability features such as Active-Active geo-redundancy.

This tutorial focuses on the **cache-aside** pattern. The goal of this design pattern is to set up **optimal** caching (load-as-you-go) for better read operations. With caching, you might be familiar with a "cache miss," where you do not find data in the cache, and a "cache hit," where you can find data in the cache. Let's look at how the cache-aside pattern works with Redis for both a "cache miss" and a "cache hit."

### Cache-aside with Redis (cache miss)

/>

This diagram illustrates the steps taken in the cache-aside pattern when there is a "cache miss." To understand how this works, consider the following process:

1. An application requests data from the backend.
1. The backend checks to find out if the data is available in Redis.
1. Data is not found (a cache miss), so the data is fetched from the database.
1. The data returned from the database is subsequently stored in Redis.
1. The data is then returned to the application.

### Cache-aside with Redis (cache hit)

Now that you have seen what a "cache miss" looks like, let's cover a "cache hit." Here is the same diagram, but with the "cache hit" steps highlighted in green.

<img
  src={cacheHitImage}
  alt="Cache hit when using the cache-aside pattern with Redis"
  width="500"
  className="margin-bottom--md"
/>

1. An application requests data from the backend.
1. The backend checks to find out if the data is available in Redis.
1. The data is then returned to the application.

The cache-aside pattern is useful when you need to:

1. **Query data frequently**: When you have a large volume of reads (as is the case in an e-commerce application), the cache-aside pattern gives you an immediate performance gain for subsequent data requests.
1. **Fill the cache on demand**: The cache-aside pattern fills the cache as data is requested rather than pre-caching, thus saving on space and cost. This is useful when it isn't clear what data will need to be cached.
1. **Be cost-conscious**: Since cache size is directly related to the cost of cache storage in the cloud, the smaller the size, the less you pay.

If you use **Redis Cloud** and a database that uses a JDBC driver, you can take advantage of [<u>**Redis Smart Cache**</u>](https://redis.com/blog/redis-smart-cache/), which lets you add caching to an application without changing the code.

## Caching in a microservices application with Redis and primary database (MongoDB/ Postgressql)

In our sample application, the products service publishes an API for filtering products. Here's what a call to the API looks like:

### Get products by filter request

```json title="docs/api/get-products-by-filter.md"
// POST http://localhost:3000/products/getProductsByFilter
{
  "productDisplayName": "puma"
}
```

### Get products by filter response (cache miss)

```json {25}
{
  "data": [
    {
      "productId": "11000",
      "price": 3995,
      "productDisplayName": "Puma Men Slick 3HD Yellow Black Watches",
      "variantName": "Slick 3HD Yellow",
      "brandName": "Puma",
      "ageGroup": "Adults-Men",
      "gender": "Men",
      "displayCategories": "Accessories",
      "masterCategory_typeName": "Accessories",
      "subCategory_typeName": "Watches",
      "styleImages_default_imageURL": "http://host.docker.internal:8080/images/11000.jpg",
      "productDescriptors_description_value": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stylish and comfortable, ...",
      "createdOn": "2023-07-13T14:07:38.020Z",
      "createdBy": "ADMIN",
      "lastUpdatedOn": "2023-07-13T14:07:38.020Z",
      "lastUpdatedBy": null,
      "statusCode": 1
    }
    //...
  ],
  "error": null,
  "isFromCache": false
}
```

### Get products by filter response (cache hit)

```json {6}
{
  "data": [
    //...same data as above
  ],
  "error": null,
  "isFromCache": true // now the data comes from the cache rather DB
}
```

### Implementing cache-aside with Redis and primary database (MongoDB/ Postgressql)

The following code shows the function used to search for products in primary database:

```typescript title="server/src/services/products/src/service-impl.ts"
async function getProductsByFilter(productFilter: Product) {
  const prisma = getPrismaClient();

  const whereQuery: Prisma.ProductWhereInput = {
    statusCode: DB_ROW_STATUS.ACTIVE,
  };

  if (productFilter && productFilter.productDisplayName) {
    whereQuery.productDisplayName = {
      contains: productFilter.productDisplayName,
      mode: 'insensitive',
    };
  }

  const products: Product[] = await prisma.product.findMany({
    where: whereQuery,
  });

  return products;
}
```

You simply make a call to primary database (MongoDB/ Postgressql) to find products based on a filter on the product's `displayName` property. You can set up multiple columns for better fuzzy searching, but we simplified it for the purposes of this tutorial.

Using primary database directly without Redis works for a while, but eventually it slows down. That's why you might use Redis, to speed things up. The cache-aside pattern helps you balance performance with cost.

The basic decision tree for cache-aside is as follows.

When the frontend requests products:

1. Form a hash with the contents of the request (i.e., the search parameters).
1. Check Redis to see if a value exists for the hash.
1. Is there a cache hit? If data is found for the hash, it is returned; the process stops here.
1. Is there a cache miss? When data is not found, it is read out of primary database and subsequently stored in Redis prior to being returned.

Here’s the code used to implement the decision tree:

```typescript title="server/src/services/products/src/routes.ts"
const getHashKey = (_filter: Document) => {
  let retKey = '';
  if (_filter) {
    const text = JSON.stringify(_filter);
    retKey = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(text).digest('hex');
  }
  return 'CACHE_ASIDE_' + retKey;
};

router.post(API.GET_PRODUCTS_BY_FILTER, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const body = req.body;
  // using node-redis
  const redis = getNodeRedisClient();

  //get data from redis
  const hashKey = getHashKey(req.body);
  const cachedData = await redis.get(hashKey);
  const docArr = cachedData ? JSON.parse(cachedData) : [];

  if (docArr && docArr.length) {
    result.data = docArr;
    result.isFromCache = true;
  } else {
    // get data from primary database
    const dbData = await getProductsByFilter(body); //method shown earlier

    if (body && body.productDisplayName && dbData.length) {
      // set data in redis (no need to wait)
      redis.set(hashKey, JSON.stringify(dbData), {
        EX: 60, // cache expiration in seconds
      });
    }

    result.data = dbData;
  }

  res.send(result);
});
```

:::tip

You need to decide what expiry or time to live (TTL) works best for your particular use case.
