Lets take a look at the architecture of the demo application:

1. `products service`: handles querying products from the database and returning them to the frontend
1. `orders service`: handles validating and creating orders
1. `order history service`: handles querying a customer's order history
1. `payments service`: handles processing orders for payment
1. `api gateway`: unifies the services under a single endpoint
1. `mongodb/ postgresql`: serves as the write-optimized database for storing orders, order history, products, etc.

You don't need to use MongoDB/ Postgresql as your write-optimized database in the demo application; you can use other <u>[prisma supported databases](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/supported-databases)</u> as well. This is just an example.
