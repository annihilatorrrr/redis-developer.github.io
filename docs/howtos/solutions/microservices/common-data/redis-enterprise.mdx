You can use **Redis Cloud** as a multi-model primary database. Redis Cloud is a fully managed, highly available, secure, and real-time data platform. It can store data on both RAM or **Flash**. It also supports **Active-Active** (multi-zone read and write replicas) on different cloud vendors, providing extreme high availability and scalability. Active-Active offers global scalability while maintaining local speed for database reads and writes.

Redis Cloud has many built-in modular capabilities, making it a unified, real-time data platform. Redis Cloud is far more than a document database.

- **JSON**: Persists JSON documents
- **Search**: Indexes and searches JSON documents
- **Probabilistic data structures**: Provides bloom filters and other probabilistic data structures
- **Time Series**: Supports time series data structures
- **Triggers and Functions**: Syncs data to external databases via different pattern (write-behind/ write-through) or executes custom logic.
