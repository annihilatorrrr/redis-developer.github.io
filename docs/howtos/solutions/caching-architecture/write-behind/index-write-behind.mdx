## What is write-behind caching?

Imagine you've built a movie streaming app. You used MongoDB as your data store, and as you needed to scale you implemented caching using Redis. This allows you to drastically speed up reads. However, now you are experiencing slowness when writing to MongoDB.

For example, maybe you want to allow users to continue watching movies where they last left off. This requires you to store the timestamp of where a user is when they decide to pause the movie. With millions of users, this is starting to cause MongoDB to slow down when you have peaks in demand.

You need a way of flattening the peaks in demand, allowing you to write data quickly and then persist it to MongoDB when the demand dies down. What you need is called the "write-behind pattern."

The pattern is simple, your application writes data to Redis and then asynchronously data gets written to MongoDB. Write operations are queued up so that the application can move on quickly and the cache can catch up over time. However, this does mean there is a short time when the data between the cache and the system of record is inconsistent.

Below is a diagram of the write-behind pattern for the application:

![write-behind-pattern using Redis in a movie streaming application](./images/pattern.jpg)

The pattern works as follows:

1. The application reads and writes data to Redis.
1. Redis syncs any changed data to the MongoDB database asynchronously.

## Why you should use Redis for write-behind caching

Consider Redis with this pattern when you need to

1. **Flatten peaks in demand**: Under stress, an application may need to write data quickly. If your application needs to perform a large number of write operations at high speed, consider Redis. The programmability capabilities of Redis make sure the data stored in the cache is synced with the database.
1. **Batch multiple writes**: Sometimes it's expensive to write to a database frequently (for example, logging). In those cases, it can be cost-effective to batch the database writes with Redis so that data syncs at intervals.
1. **Offload the primary database**: Database load is reduced when heavy writes operate on Redis, So we can spread writes to improve performance during the peak time of application usage.

## Write behind caching in a NodeJS application with Redis and MongoDB

### Demo application

<CachingMovieAppDesign />

<SourceCodeMovieApp />

To demonstrate this pattern using the movie application, imagine that the user opens the pop-up to add a new movie.

![demo-02](../common-caching/images/demo-02.png)

Instead of the application immediately storing the data in MongoDB, the application writes the changes to Redis. In the background, RedisGears automatically synchronizes the data with the MongoDB database.

### Programming Redis using the write-behind pattern

Developers need to load some code (say python in our example) to the Redis server before using the write-behind pattern (which syncs data from Redis to MongoDB). The Redis server has a RedisGears module that interprets the python code and syncs the data from Redis to MongoDB.

Loading the Python code is easier than it sounds. Simply replace database details in the Python file and then load the file to the Redis server.

Create the Python file (shown below, and [available online](https://github.com/redis-developer/ebook-speed-mern-backend/blob/main/data/write-behind/movies-write-behind.py)). Then update the MongoDB connection details, database, collection, and primary key name to sync.

```python title="movies-write-behind.py"
# Gears Recipe for a single write behind

# import redis gears & mongo db libs
from rgsync import RGJSONWriteBehind, RGJSONWriteThrough
from rgsync.Connectors import MongoConnector, MongoConnection

# change mongodb connection (admin)
# mongodb://usrAdmin:passwordAdmin@10.10.20.2:27017/dbSpeedMernDemo?authSource=admin
mongoUrl = 'mongodb://usrAdmin:passwordAdmin@10.10.20.2:27017/admin'

# MongoConnection(user, password, host, authSource?, fullConnectionUrl?)
connection = MongoConnection('', '', '', '', mongoUrl)

# change MongoDB database
db = 'dbSpeedMernDemo'

# change MongoDB collection & it's primary key
movieConnector = MongoConnector(connection, db, 'movies', 'movieId')

# change redis keys with prefix that must be synced with mongodb collection
RGJSONWriteBehind(GB,  keysPrefix='MovieEntity',
                  connector=movieConnector, name='MoviesWriteBehind',
                  version='99.99.99')
```

:::tip What is a RedisGears recipe?

A collection of RedisGears functions and any dependencies they may have that implement a high-level functional purpose is called a `recipe`.
Example : "RGJSONWriteBehind" function in above python code

:::

There are two ways to load that Python file into the Redis server:

1. Using the gears command-line interface (CLI)

Find more information about the Gears CLI at [gears-cli](https://github.com/RedisGears/gears-cli) and [rgsync](https://github.com/RedisGears/rgsync#running-the-recipe).

```sh
# install
pip install gears-cli
```

```sh
# If python file is located at “/users/tom/movies-write-behind.py”
gears-cli --host <redisHost> --port <redisPort> --password <redisPassword> run /users/tom/movies-write-behind.py REQUIREMENTS rgsync pymongo==3.12.0
```

2. Using the RG.PYEXECUTE from the Redis command line.

Find more information at [RG.PYEXECUTE](https://oss.redis.com/redisgears/commands.html#rgpyexecute).

```sh
# Via redis cli
RG.PYEXECUTE 'pythonCode' REQUIREMENTS rgsync pymongo==3.12.0
```

The RG.PYEXECUTE command can also be executed from the Node.js code
(Consult [the sample Node file](https://github.com/redis-developer/ebook-speed-mern-backend/blob/main/data/write-behind/wb-main.js) for more details)

Find more examples at [Redis Gears sync with MongoDB](https://github.com/RedisGears/rgsync/tree/master/examples/mongo).

### Verifying the write-behind pattern using RedisInsight

:::tip

RedisInsight is the free redis GUI for viewing data in redis. <u>[Click here to download.](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/)</u>

:::

The next step is to verify that RedisGears is syncing data between Redis and MongoDB.

Insert a key starting with the prefix (that's specified in the Python file) using the Redis CLI

![redis-insight](./images/redis-insight.png)

Next, confirm that the JSON is inserted in MongoDB too.

  alt="mongo-compass"
  width="500"
  className="margin-bottom--md"
/>

You can also check [RedisInsight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) to verify that the data is piped in via Streams for its consumers (like RedisGears).

![redis-insight-stream](./images/redis-insight-stream.png)

How does all that work with the demo application? Below is a code snipped to insert a movie. Once data is written to Redis, RedisGears automatically synchronizes it to MongoDB.

```js title="BEFORE (using MongoDB)"
...
//(Node mongo query)
if (movie) {
  //insert movie to MongoDB
  await db.collection("movies")
           .insertOne(movie);
}
...
```

```js title="AFTER (using Redis)"
...
//(Redis OM Node query)
if (movie) {
  const entity = repository.createEntity(movie);
  //insert movie to Redis
  await moviesRepository.save(entity);
}
...
```
